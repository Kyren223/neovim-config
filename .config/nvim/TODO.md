# Plans for the future

- TODO: Look into bufferline.nvim for "tabs"
- TODO: Look at configuring Noice.nvim and decide if u like it or not
- TODO: Look at buffer-management plugins that automatically delete old buffers (and also ways to close buffers without exiting nvim, and be able to exit nvim with 1 keypress)
- TODO: Replace obsidian with Neorg
- TODO: Add refactoring keys like <leader>iv for introduce variable, extract method, introduce constant etc
- TODO: Decided which outline-plugin to use (lspsaga or aerial, or smthing else)
- TODO: Finish configuring lsp saga (I think it has supertypes and stuff which aren't in the doc)
- TODO: Remove the vsc*de snippets/completions and make my own luasnip snippets [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmHhonPjvvA)
- TODO: Setup [nvim spectre](https://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre)
