# Plans for the future

- TODO: Look into bufferline.nvim for "tabs"
- TODO: Look at configuring Noice.nvim and decide if u like it or not
- TODO: Look at buffer-management plugins that automatically delete old buffers (and also ways to close buffers without exiting nvim, and be able to exit nvim with 1 keypress)
- TODO: Replace obsidian with Neorg
- TODO: Add refactoring keys like <leader>iv for introduce variable, extract method, introduce constant etc
- TODO: Decided which outline-plugin to use (lspsaga or aerial, or smthing else)
- TODO: Finish configuring lsp saga (I think it has supertypes and stuff which aren't in the doc)
- TODO: Remove the vsc*de snippets/completions and make my own luasnip snippets [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmHhonPjvvA)
- TODO: Setup [nvim spectre](https://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre)

# VERY IMPORTANT

##  TODO: Code actions
Don't show bs code actions (some kind of filter for "quickfix" and "refactor.extract" potentially?)
Sort quickfix actions to be first and then the rest less important ones
Alt enter should show a list of code actions
A lightbulb somewhere ONLY if the cursor (not line) has a code action and ONLY if it's a quickfix

##  TODO: Completions and snippets
Remove all the bs vscode snippets
Make my own snippets per file type
Learn how to navigate between snippet params
HAVE ACTUAL GOOD SORTING FOR SNIPPETS (hopefully this is possible)
when there is an lsp active, it shouldn't show any other types like regex
it should just show lsp stuff
